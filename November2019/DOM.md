- Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTMl and XML documents.
- It represents the page that programs can change the document structure, style and content.
- DOM represents the document as nodes and objects.
- A Web page is a document; it can be displayed in the browser window or as the HTMl source - but it is the same document in both cases.
- DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.
